title: "City of Winnipeg - Insect Control Branch"
subtitle: Modelling mosquito populations
summary: |
  The [City of Winnipeg’s Insect Control
  Branch](https://winnipeg.ca/publicworks/insectcontrol/default.stm) (ICB) of
  the Public Works Department provides services to Winnipeg residents to control
  insects, including mosquitoes. The mosquito control program is based on an
  environmentally mindful insect control strategy, and includes: (1) A
  larviciding program that is 100% biological and uses four larviciding
  helicopters, (2) Monitoring and treating over 31,500 hectares of water area on
  an ongoing basis based on weather conditions, and (3) Monitoring for adult
  nuisance mosquitoes in New Jersey Light Traps beginning early May.

  In this project, we will examine some of the key challenges facing the ICB
  such as (1) Predictive modelling of adult mosquito populations subject to
  changes in rainfall/soil moisture content and wind speed (2) Preditictive
  modelling of larval development subject to changes in spring and summer
  temperatures.

## Problem Statement


The [City of Winnipeg’s Insect Control
Branch](https://winnipeg.ca/publicworks/insectcontrol/default.stm) (ICB) of
the Public Works Department provides services to Winnipeg residents to control
insects, including mosquitoes. The mosquito control program is based on an
environmentally mindful insect control strategy, and includes: (1) A
larviciding program that is 100% biological and uses four larviciding
helicopters, (2) Monitoring and treating over 31,500 hectares of water area on
an ongoing basis based on weather conditions, and (3) Monitoring for adult
nuisance mosquitoes in New Jersey Light Traps beginning early May.

Key challenges currently facing the ICB include…

  * predictive modelling of rainfall/soil moisture content/adult mosquito count
  * predictive modelling of larval development versus temperature for spring and
    summer mosquito species
  * predictive modelling of adult mosquito population and daily wind speed (ie.
    Migration from outside of city to inside of city)
  * how rainfall impacts soil moisture (how quickly absorbed in ground)

## Data Sources
ICB data is available on the City of Winnipeg’s Open Data Portal:
  1. [Insect Control - Helicopter Flight
     Spray](https://data.winnipeg.ca/Insect-Control/Insect-Control-Helicopter-Flight-Spray/pk9u-zvrf),
  1. [Daily Adult Mosquito Trap
Data](https://data.winnipeg.ca/Insect-Control/Daily-Adult-Mosquito-Trap-Data/du7c-8488)
for the past 6 years
  1. [311 Service
     Requests](https://data.winnipeg.ca/Contact-Centre-311/311-Service-Request/4her-3th5),
     including Mosquito Complaints. More datasets may be made available soon.
     In addition to the City’s Open Data, relevant data on temperature,
     precipitation, and elevation can be obtained from various sources.

## Prerequisites
There is no prerequisite knowledge strongly needed for this problem, but
familiarity with GIS data analytics and biological (especially mosquito) life
cycles is preferred
