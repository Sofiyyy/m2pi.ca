title: "IOTO International"
subtitle: Developing/testing performance metrics for politicians
summary: |
  Performance metrics in sports have seen remarkable growth and development.
  What if we turned some of these mathematical tools on political performance?
  Building on [last year’s M2PI project](/project/2020/ioto-international/), the
  goal of this year’s project is to analyze data related to the activities of
  legislators in Canada and the USA with a view to developing engineered
  features which might reflect political performance. These engineered features
  should be granular enough to significantly inflect during the course of a
  parliamentary or legislative session, providing quantitative and comparative
  performance insight.

## Problem Statement

Performance metrics in sports have seen remarkable growth and development.
What if we turned some of these mathematical tools on political performance?
Building on [last year’s M2PI project](/project/2020/ioto-international/), the
goal of this year’s project is to analyze data related to the activities of
legislators in Canada and the USA with a view to developing engineered
features which might reflect political performance. These engineered features
should be granular enough to significantly inflect during the course of a
parliamentary or legislative session, providing quantitative and comparative
performance insight. 

## Skills
A background in statistics or graph theory would be helpful. Some experience
with computer programming or data science may be helpful, but is not necessary.
