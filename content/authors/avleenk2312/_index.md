##

Avleen is currently a Ph.D. Mathematics student at the University of Manitoba. Her supervisor is Prof. Shaun Lui. She specializes in analysis, computer science, linear algebra, numerical analysis and partial differential equations. Her current research is developing new estimates for the minimum singular value of 2x2 block matrices, space-time spectral methods for the Stokes problem, and designing a fast solver for linear systems arising from the space-time spectral methods. She is passionate about teaching and learning new mathematical concepts. She is seeking research opportunities in academia.
